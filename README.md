# Report: Data Scraping AND INSIGHTS of 2024 GENERAL Election Results

## Technical Details:
Utilized Python libraries, BeautifulSoup and Requests, to scrape data from the official Election Commission of India website (https://results.eci.gov.in), which contains the election results for India in 2024. 
The aim was to extract comprehensive details such as seats won, seats lost, total seats, leading seats, state-wise results, and member-wise results. Using the Requests library, I sent HTTP requests to 
fetch the HTML content of the webpage. BeautifulSoupwas then employed to parse this HTML content and extract relevant data. The data extraction process involved identifying specific HTML tags and 
classes that contained the necessary information about the election results.
I focused on several key elements:
 •Seats Win/Lose/Total: Extracted the number of seats each party won, lost, and their total tally.
 •Leading Seats: Identified the number of seats where each party was leading.
 •State-wise Results: Gathered data on the election results from each state.
 •Member-wise Results: Compiled detailed results for individual members, including their winning or losing status.
The scraped data was then organized into a structured format, enabling further analysis and visualization. This approach ensured accurate and up-to-date information was collected efficiently, providing 
valuable insights into the 2024 election 
outcomes.

## Report: Insights Generation on India 2024 Election Results Using Power BI
 • For analyzing the India 2024 election results, I scraped data from the Election Commission of India's official website (https://results.eci.gov.in) using Python's BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries. 
   The goal was to extract detailed information on seats won, lost, total seats, leading seats, state-wise results, and member-wise results.
 • After collecting the raw data, I used Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries to clean and preprocess it. This involved handling missing values, correcting data formats, and organizing the data
   into structured dataframes. These steps were crucial in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the subsequent analysis.
 • With the cleaned data, I imported it into Power BI for visualization and insights generation. Key insights included:
 • Party Performance: Visualization of seats won, lost, and total for each party, highlighting their overall performance.
 • Leading Trends: Analysis of leading seats to identify potential winners in various regions.
 • State-wise Analysis: Comparative analysis of election results across different states to identify regional strongholds and battlegrounds.
 • Member-wise Results: Detailed insights into the performance of individual candidates, including win/loss status and vote margins.
 • Power BI's robust visualization tools enabled me to create interactive dashboards, making it easier to interpret the election results and uncover trends and patterns. 
   This comprehensive approach provided valuable insights into the 2024 election outcomes, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.
